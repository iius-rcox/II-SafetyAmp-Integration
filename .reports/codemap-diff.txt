Summary
-------
Status: INITIAL CREATION
Diff Percentage: 100% (new files)

Files Created
-------------
1. codemaps/architecture.md - Overall system architecture and data flow
2. codemaps/backend.md - Python services, sync operations, utilities
3. codemaps/frontend.md - N/A (backend-only service notation)
4. codemaps/data.md - Data models, schemas, caching, validation

Architecture Highlights Captured
--------------------------------
- Project Type: Python Backend Integration Service
- Framework: Flask with Gunicorn
- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes (AKS)
- External Systems: SafetyAmp, Vista/Viewpoint, Samsara, Microsoft Graph

Key Modules Documented
----------------------
config/           - ConfigManager (Azure Key Vault + env vars)
services/         - API clients (SafetyAmp, Viewpoint, Graph, Samsara)
                  - Data management (caching, events)
sync/             - Sync operations (employees, vehicles, departments, jobs, titles)
utils/            - Logging, metrics, health, validation, resilience

Patterns Identified
-------------------
- Singleton pattern for global services
- Base class for sync operations
- Context managers for DB connections
- Decorators for rate limiting/retry
- Circuit breaker for fault tolerance

Data Flow Documented
--------------------
Sources: Vista SQL Server, Microsoft Graph, Samsara API
Target: SafetyAmp API
Caching: Redis with file fallback
Tracking: Event manager, failed sync tracker
