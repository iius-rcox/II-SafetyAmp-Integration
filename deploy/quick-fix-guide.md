# 🔧 SafetyAmp Integration - Quick Fix Guide

## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

Based on the error analysis, your SafetyAmp integration has the following data quality issues:

### **Missing Required Fields (422 Errors)**
- **41 employees** missing `first_name`
- **40 employees** missing `last_name`
- **34 employees** missing `email`

### **Duplicate Data**
- **1 duplicate mobile phone** number
- **1 duplicate email** address

### **Site Mapping Issues**
- Employees being skipped due to missing site mappings

## 🛠️ Immediate Fixes Required

### **1. Fix Missing Required Fields**

**Action Required:** Update your source system to ensure all employees have required fields.

**SQL Query to Find Missing Data:**
```sql
-- Find employees missing first_name
SELECT id, last_name, email, mobile_phone 
FROM employees 
WHERE first_name IS NULL OR first_name = '';

-- Find employees missing last_name
SELECT id, first_name, email, mobile_phone 
FROM employees 
WHERE last_name IS NULL OR last_name = '';

-- Find employees missing email
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, mobile_phone 
FROM employees 
WHERE email IS NULL OR email = '';
```

**Quick Fix Options:**
1. **Generate missing emails:** `firstname.lastname@company.com`
2. **Use default names:** "Unknown" for missing first/last names
3. **Skip invalid records:** Temporarily exclude employees with missing data

### **2. Fix Duplicate Data**

**Action Required:** Identify and resolve duplicate mobile phones and emails.

**SQL Query to Find Duplicates:**
```sql
-- Find duplicate emails
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as count, GROUP_CONCAT(id) as employee_ids
FROM employees 
WHERE email IS NOT NULL AND email != ''
GROUP BY email 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Find duplicate mobile phones
SELECT mobile_phone, COUNT(*) as count, GROUP_CONCAT(id) as employee_ids
FROM employees 
WHERE mobile_phone IS NOT NULL AND mobile_phone != ''
GROUP BY mobile_phone 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### **3. Fix Site Mappings**

**Action Required:** Add missing site mappings for departments like "PRDept 23".

**Check your site mapping configuration and add:**
```python
# Example site mapping
SITE_MAPPINGS = {
    "PRDept 23": "default_site_id",
    # Add other missing mappings
}
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Commands

Use these commands to monitor the fixes:

```powershell
# Monitor errors in real-time
.\monitor-logs.ps1 -Mode "errors" -Hours 1

# Check for specific error types
